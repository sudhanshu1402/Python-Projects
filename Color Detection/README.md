# Color Detection

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Simple isnâ€™t it? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We have used somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
In the project color detection , we have build an application through which user can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them.
