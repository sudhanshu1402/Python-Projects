# TIC TAC TOE
There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.
The gameplay will be as follows.
- First, one user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
- Next, the second user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.
- The goal of the players is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise, or diagonally.
- The game goes on until a player wins the game or it ended up in a draw by filling all boxes without a winning match.
